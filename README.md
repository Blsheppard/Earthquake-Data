# Earthquake-Data
Downloaded datasets from online resources and created visualizations of a world map plotting said data.

In this project I progressed in how to download datasets from online resources and create working visualiztions for that data.I used the json module to access earthquake data stored in the GEOJSON format and used Plotly's scatter_geo() to draw a world map showing the locations and magnitudes of recent earthquakes. I was able to process GeoJSON files and extract the data I wanted to analyze, and customize the style of the map I created with Ploty.
